# Mininet_Mesh-Topology_OSPF_BGP
Implemented custom Mesh Topology in Mininet and recorded, visualized and contrasted the critical differences in its performances when tested in conjunction with two well-known routing protocols: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF Protocol). We quantified our results in terms of 2 performance metrics: throughput and jitter.
